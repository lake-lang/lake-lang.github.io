    <h1>Lake for expert programmers</h1>

    <p>
        This page provides an overview of Lake for those who feel comfortable using a programming language such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C#, or C++. From the point of view of Lake, such languages are considered expert languages. If you feel comfortable using such a language, you are considered an expert programmer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lake is a general-purpose programming language designed to be just powerful enough for an average person with a computer to create all sorts of useful or fun programs. For example, with Lake you can read a CSV file of your bank transfers, explore the data, draw a pie-chart on screen, or store the it as an image file. Or, create a custom version of Tetris, Mine Sweeper, or Space Invaders. Less impressive but also useful: quickly divide a group of people into smaller groups. With Lake you can't render impressive 3D graphics, communicate with other devices or create commercial software. Compared to languages also used by experts such as Python, JavaScript, and Java, Lake is limited. But, because of its limitations, there is less to learn, less to worry about, and less that can go wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using Lake requires minimal hassle. If you have a web browser you can use Lake. No installation, no login.
    </p>

    <p class="alert">
        
            Keep this in mind when recommending any programming language. As an expert programmer, you probably have a natural talent for programming, which is very rare. You probably intuitively understand things about programming that most people take very long to understand or can never understand. You probably do not realize how extremely much more difficult expert languages are to most people than they are to you or other experts.
