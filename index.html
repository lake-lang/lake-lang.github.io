        <p>
            Programming can be useful and fun for the average person. But, available programming languages are either
            very powerful but hard and frustrating (because they are designed to also be useful to experts), or easy but
            too weak (because they are designed as an introduction to programming). Lake is powerful enough to enable
            the average person to do serious programming, and tries to make this serious programming as easy and smooth
            as possible.

        <p>To make Lake is a better tool for programming tasks, not a tool to learn programming. </p>
